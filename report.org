* Evaluation
** How far is our dictionary from the true color dict?
** Kmeans neighbour information
** Post processing?
** High confidence in cluster assignment?
If distance is close, and this is a popular cluster, then highlight this

** Manually find percentage(cartman) and compare

** Histogram comparisons between kmeans/assigned clusters

** Confusion matrix
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/plot_confusion_matrix.html

** Do multiple segmentations? Smaller segments and then see what happens?

** Train dict on one episode, test on another. Compare with own dict

** Pre-populate dict with standard segments?
